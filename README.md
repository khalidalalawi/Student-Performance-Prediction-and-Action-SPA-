Student Performance Prediction and Action (SPA):
Student Performance Prediction and Action (SPA) is a comprehensive system that considers the entre life cycle of a course from design and delivery to evaluation. It incorporates (i.) predictive models to identify at-risk students during the term; (ii.) real-time feedback and customised study plan tailored to individual learning behaviour throughout LA dashboards; and (iii.) a curriculum design feature following Biggs’ constructive alignment principles to develop a mapping model that maps learning outcomes to teaching/learning activities and assessments. The SPA provides an LA-based feature enabling educators to deliver personalised email interventions for predicted at-risk students using students’ learning data/behaviour.  SPA has six features/Technology artefacts: Mapping Module, Student Performance Prediction Module, Student Feedback Module, Academic Dashboard Module, and Course Evaluation Module.
